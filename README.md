Hi! I'm a microcontroller enthusiast who loves working with stm32 and esp32 chips.

I enjoy designing and soldering PCBs, and I use Altium Designer, Kicad, and EasyEDA as my main EDA tools.

I have a shelf full of electronic components, which are really hard to organize...

My primary programming languages are C and Python.

I'm currently learning Rust and Godot, as well as improving my English skills.
